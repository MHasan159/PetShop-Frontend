#  E-Commerce Store

The E-Commerce site made with React and Redux for the frontend and Ruby on Rails for the backend. The site has full user support with registering and signing in. A user can view, review, and purchase items! A user will add items to their cart, proceed through the checkout wizard and place an order that is persisted to the backend.
